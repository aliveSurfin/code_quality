19/02/2022:\
The first sprint was interrupted due to catching covid. This halted work from 06/02/2022.

This also delayed the starting of the second sprint from 14/02/2022 to 21/02/2022.

Despite this the first week of Sprint 1 had progress with

- Setting up the development environment
  - Node js server to run all logic
  - React Application front end
  - Testing with Jest
- Interface
  - Code entry interface
    - syntax highlighting
    - code selection
  - closeable panels
    - settings panel

**Retrospective**


With the lost time I feel it is necessary to re-calibrate my user stories. I will be performing 
1. MoSCoW Analysis
2. T-shirt sizing
3. Value/Risk
4. Creating Priorities from MoSCoW + Value/risk
5. Planning Poker

The actual development went well during the spring, I believe the test driven development approach I am taking is making development go smoother. 

Next sprint I will attempt to log extra hours to make up for the development downtime this sprint, this will be factored in the planning stage. This will move budgeted time per week to approx 40 hours.
