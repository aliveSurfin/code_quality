\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this project was to understand the code quality analysis process and 
learn how parsing is done, the student believes this has been achieved. The artifact produced 
meets the requirements of 18/30 of the user stories created, with the majority of the stories left 
uncompleted being smaller stories that are made easier by the work that has been completed.
\newline
Coming into this project with no understanding of how static analysis worked and how parsers were 
made it has been a great learning experience that the student believes will benefit them 
in the long term.
how do we take what we have learned forward 
\newline
The final artifact created needs work to be a widely used application but as the results from the 
user testing show, it has created an interest in the participants in code quality analysis. This is justification 
enough to the student that it has been a success.
