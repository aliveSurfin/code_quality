\section{Future Work}
There is scope within the project for further work to be done, I will discuss these now.
\subsection{Expanding of Syntax Support}
The parser supports a lot of the JavaScript language although it does not support modern features, bringing the parser 
up to date to support the full JavaSript grammar \cite{ecmascript2017}.

\subsection{Allow Settings}
It would be great to allow the user to select what analysis they want to perform, this would be beneficial for teaching as 
the educator could customise the output depending on the level of study.
